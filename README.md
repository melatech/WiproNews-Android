This app shows a list of the latest news headlines taken from different websites around the internet.
I have implemented an advance **SearchView** mechanism which allows the user to search any news topic
they desire.

The user will be able to tap on a news item in the **RecyclerView** and view the full news article
which is displayed on **WebView**. If the user desires to read the article at a later date the user
